## Problem 1

Some order of magnitude calculations for compact binary systems:

a) estimate the maximum frequency a binary system will achieve before the components plunge for

  - black holes with m1 = m2 = 30 Msun
  - neutron stars m1 = m2 = 1.4 and r1 = r2 = 13km

b) estimate the amplitude of the strain observed at Earth for a binary black hole systems with

  - m1 = m2 = 30 Msun
  - orbital frequency at ISCO
  - luminosity distance of 200 Mpc from Earth

c) what is the characteristic frequency of a Black Hole's normal modes? (hint, what is the light-travel time?)

## Problem 2

Using the quadropole approximation and neglecting radiation reaction, compute the strain for the general Keplerian trajectory of two point masses in Newtonian gravity. You can work in the center-of-mass frame.

## Extra (not graded)

Using the detector tensor and the definitions of all GW polarizations, plot the antenna power patterns across the sky for each polarization. Assume a cartesian coordinate system aligned with the detector arms. Is there anything special about the antenna pattern for breathing and longitudinal modes?
